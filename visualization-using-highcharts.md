# Visualization using Highcharts

### Highcharts introduction

Highcharts is a javascript library which is very popularly used to create data visualizations. The main objective of using highcharts is to visualize our sentiment results for different gulf airlines.

Weâ€™ll first separate our tweets based on the airline and find out the sentiment distribution for each airline. We will then use bar chart to visualize our sentiment results.

#### 1. Preparing data for visualization

We first need to filter the tweets and their generated sentiment by airline. So we scrap tweets by airline name from the sentimentUniqueTweets.csv file.

> _**Save the following script as scrapAirlineTweets.py and run the script once and run again by editing thescrapTweets\("qatarairways"\)by using emirates and etihadairways.**_

The script will generate individual files containing tweets about each airline.

```py
'''
scraps and stores tweets by airline
'''

import csv

sntTweets = csv.reader(open("search-data/sentimentUniqueTweets.csv", 'rb'))

def scrapTweets(airline):
    airwayTweet = csv.writer(open("search-data/"+airline+"Tweets.csv", "wb"))
    # store tweets by airways
    count = 1
    for row in sntTweets:
        r = row[2].lower()
        r = row[2].strip('#').strip('@')
        if airline in r:
            count = count + 1
            airwayTweet.writerow(row)
    print "# of rows", count

scrapTweets("qatarairways") # replace with emirates and etihadairways and run this script again
```

Now we need to calculate the number of tweets which were positive, negative and neutral for each airline. This is to find the statistics of the sentiment results generated.

> _**Save the following script as computeResults.py and run the script to compute results.**_

The script when executed, generates results.csv, containing total, positive, negative and neutral number of tweets for each airline.

```py
'''
compute total, positive, negative and neutral tweets for each airline
'''

import csv

def getStats(s, fileRead):
    tot = 0;
    pos = 0;
    neg = 0;
    neu = 0;
    for row in fileRead:
        tot = tot + 1;
        if row[4] == "positive":
            pos = pos + 1;
        elif row[4] == "negative":
            neg = neg + 1;
        elif row[4] == "neutral":
            neu = neu + 1;
    print "Tweets Stats for", s
    print "total tweets: ", tot
    print "positive: ", pos
    print "negative: ", neg
    print "neutral: ", neu
    results.writerow([s, tot, pos, neg, neu])

qatarTweets = csv.reader(open("search-data/qatarairwaysTweets.csv", "rb"))
emirateTweets = csv.reader(open("search-data/emiratesTweets.csv", "rb"))
etihadTweets = csv.reader(open("search-data/etihadairwaysTweets.csv", "rb"))
results = csv.writer(open("search-data/results.csv", "wb"))

getStats("qatar", qatarTweets)
getStats("emirates", emirateTweets)
getStats("etihad", etihadTweets)
```

The results.csv will have the data in following format:

#### 2. Visualizing sentiment results using Highcharts

Now to visualize the results, we use Highcharts javascript library. Highcharts have different types of charts, as[displayed here](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/). We will implement a basic grouped column chart - [found here](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/column-basic).

> _**Download jQuery from **_[_**https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js**_](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js)
>
> _**Download the highcharts javascript library from **_[_**http://www.highcharts.com/download**_](http://www.highcharts.com/download)_**. Click on Highcharts 5.0.7 to download**_
>
> _**Extract the library and copy paste the highcharts.js file from code folder.**_
>
> _**The jquery and highcharts javascript files should now be copy pasted inside lib \(new folder\) of your project folder.**_
>
> _**Create a new file results.html and save the following code.**_
>
> **Locate the results.html file and double-click on the results.html file to execute it using your desired browser.**

You will see a column bar chart like below in your browser:

### And that should be it! Congrats :\)
